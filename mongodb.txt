1. What is MongoDB?
=> MongoDB is a popular and widely used open-source NoSQL database management system. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable manner, making it particularly well-suited for modern applications that require the storage and management of large datasets.

=> MongoDB is schemaless, which means that documents in a collection do not need to have a fixed structure. This flexibility makes it easy to evolve the schema as application requirements change.

=> MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means you can add more servers to your database cluster to handle increased data or traffic.

=> MongoDB supports replication, which allows you to create copies of your data on multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

=> MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, making it suitable for applications that require location-based services.

=> MongoDB is commonly used in a wide range of applications, including content management systems, e-commerce platforms, social media applications, real-time analytics, and more. Its flexibility and scalability make it a popular choice for developers and organizations looking for a modern database.
